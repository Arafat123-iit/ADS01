# Honor Code
In this assignment, we are going to establish a honor code. It means I am going to trust on your abilities, I will trust that you and you alone worked on your submission, and it will reflect your efforts. In case you take help from a friend, or a classmate, or a website, or from any other source - you will have to provide the details about how you received the help and to what extent. Please include it in the [Contributions.md] file. Your code will be checked for plagiarism, and if your code fails to follow the honor code, your marks and grade will be severely affected.
